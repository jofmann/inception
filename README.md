# Inception

## Description

Inception is a system administration and Docker-oriented project focused
on building a small, containerized infrastructure composed of multiple
services.

The goal of the project is to gain a deep understanding of
containerization, service isolation, networking, and deployment using
Docker and Docker Compose. Instead of relying on a traditional virtual
machine setup, the project requires designing a modular architecture
where each service runs inside its own container.

This project typically includes services such as:

-   NGINX with TLS
-   WordPress with PHP-FPM
-   MariaDB
-   Docker volumes and networks

The infrastructure is designed to be reproducible, isolated, and easily
deployable.
